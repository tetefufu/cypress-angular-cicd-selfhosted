# cypress-angular-cicd-selfhosted
- Run Cypress tests against localhost angular website as opposed to a deployed environment of the website
- This allows latest angular website changes and latest tests to be tested together 
- Allows PRs to be tested

### Getting Started

`npm run cypress:ci`

### Roadmap

- Upgrade Angular and Cypress
- Less boilerplate code
- instructions to start from cratch (e.g. insall angular, install cypress, add config...)
